    <td width="439"><span class="style24"><span class="style25">FloydCraft WebOS</span> is an InBrowser Windows Like WebApp Management system forked from Webdows <br>
        It serves as a place our players can access specific  minecraft and server related stuff without accessing untrusted sites themselves, The main reason  for this project is to give our players a shared office suite, shared coding environment  and access to various  WebApps
that are often hard to find and work as well as there installable software rivals, for example Photoshop is a well known and very expensive  piece of software, in WebOS we have linked a trusted clone of photoshop named PhotoPea that offers the same features   photoshop does and a lot more.</span></td>
